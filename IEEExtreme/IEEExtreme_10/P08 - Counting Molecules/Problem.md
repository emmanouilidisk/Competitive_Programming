# Couting Molecules
Your task is to count the number of molecules in a cup of soda which contains [distilled water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water), [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide), and [glucose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose). You have a machine that counts the number of atoms of [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon), [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen), and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) in a given sample.

## Input Format
The input consists of a single line with three space separated integers: *c*, *h*, and *o*

where
*c* is the count of carbon atoms
*h* is the count of hydrogen atoms
*o* is the count of oxygen atoms

## Constraints
```
0 â‰¤ c, h
o < 10^10
```

## Output Format
If the number of atoms **is consistent** with a mixture containing **only water, carbon dioxide, and glucose molecules**, the output should consist of a single line containing three space separated integers: the number of water molecules, the number of carbon dioxide molecules, and the number of glucose molecules.

If the number of atoms **is not consistent** with a mixture containing **only water, carbon dioxide, and glucose molecules**, the output should consist of a line containing the word `Error`

## Sample Input
```
10 0 20
```

## Sample Output
```
0 10 0
```

## Explanation
The input indicates that there are 10 carbon atoms and 20 oxygen atoms. The only way that this could occur would be if there were 0 water molecules, 10 carbon dioxide molecules, and 0 glucose molecules.

Note that there are additional sample inputs available if you click on the `Run Code` button.
